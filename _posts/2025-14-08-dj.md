My wife bought me a DDJ FLX4, a DJ controller, for my birthday. It was unexpected, but in hindsight, I have been talking about DJing quite a bit. I had a hunch I'd like it. I didn't think I'd love it. For the past couple of months, I have been spending several hours each weekend, and occasionally during the week, DJing. I have a DJ spot, in the corner of the living room, right by my bookshelf. It's a rather unglamorous spot. My DJ controller is on the wooden floor. I face the living room heater. The laptop a few inches away, wired up to the controller, with another 3.5mm jack cable wired up to a portable JBL speaker, that has been a fixture in my living space since my undergrad days in Manipal. It's a rather humble setup. 

But the humility ends at that â€“ I think I have a real (still unrealized) talent in DJing. I have been (not so) subtly bringing up the fact that I am now a DJ in conversation. At the moment, I exclusively perform for myself, and occasion, my wife.
In the times I bring up the fact that I am now, in fact, a DJ, I realize commoners often have a misconstrued understanding of what a DJ is. I don't blame them, since I have been in that unfortunate position for the better part of my life (in fact, up until a few months ago).

### What is a DJ?
