It is indeed true that if you eat enough ghee every day, your customer acquisition cost reduces.

### Safety in permutations

If you read and thought about the opener for this essay, you'd realise that it makes no sense. You'd be sensible in thinking that. In all probability, that is a sentence that has never been put to ink (or pixel) until today. It may be a stupid sentence, sure, but it is a creative one. This (or rather, _these kinds of sentences_) motivate me. Being all of twenty three, I carry within me the naive hope that I would bring value to this world by doing something different. Building something game-changing[^1]. 

I find safety in knowing all permutations are not exhausted. Anyone could have thought of my opening sentence. But nobody did. It's because there are a trillion other (more useful) sentences that people would write. I like to think of these "brand new sentences" as an analogy for stuff; stuff ranging from startups, to books, to side-projects.  As a builder of things, a thinker of ideas, I like to think that my ideas and things are closer to gibberish sentences that nobody has ever spoken before. [InternetBlogCo](https://internetblog.co/) was sentence that was spoken a few times, but for all intents and purposes, was a brand new sentence. And considering I have a [user](https://internetblog.co/atharva/) who truly likes the service, the sentence may even make a bit of sense. Now enough of this silly little analogy.

### Enough TAM for us all

The world has 8 billion people. That's an insane number of people. Whatever you make, and yourself enjoy, you will find an audience for it. It may not be a very large audience, but it will be an audience none the less. Nothing proves this hypothesis of mine better than the website [Indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/). Let's take an example to illustrate my point (an example that blew me away when I first read about it last year).

#### OilPriceApi.com

[Gareth Fuller](https://twitter.com/garethafuller) started his career in the oil and gas industry right after graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from his home country of Scotland. Being from the oil and gas industry, he wanted to create a Twitter bot that tweeted the price of oil every hour so that he could keep a track of it easily. On doing some research on how he could build one, he realised that there is no easy way to programmatically find the price of oil. So he set about building an API that scraped oil prices from multiple live sources and averaged them out. Integrating this with the Twitter API, he came up with [OilPriceHourly](https://twitter.com/oilpricehourly), a twitter bot that tweeted the price of oil every hour. The bot was, for whatever reason, a hit. Seeing this, Gareth figured there'd be more people out there who would be interested in his weird little crude oil API. As result, he came up with [OilPriceAPI.com](https://www.oilpriceapi.com/), his first ever revenue generating side project. Turns out, he found a whole host of other weirdos that are willing to pay to have crude oil prices in the form of an API.

"Let me build SaaS for find live crude oil prices" was, in this case, the sentence that had never been uttered before. And it was just sensible enough that he found a consistent paying user base for his service. 

There are thousands of projects, businesses and startup like these who have managed to find a niche that resonated with more people than you'd think. And the funny thing is, many times these "niches" may not even be niches. It's hard to think of a world without Github, Gitlab, or other online version control services, but just about 14 years ago, none of these services existed. "What if we had a shared online version control server as a service" was unheard of sentence. I live on the hope that there a million such senteces yet to be spoken, and in the future, I may the blessed utterer of such a sentence.

### The best sourdough vegan pizza in west Whitefield. 

Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert wrote in his piece[^2] about being having a succesful career that the best way to be succesful is:

1. Be the best at something.
2. Be very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NMWNlkD.png" height="500">

That, he says, was his secret to success. He is "above average" skills created an intersection that he dominated. He says:

>  In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

Dilbert lay at the intersection of his three "top 25%" skills. He really hit that big business boi sweet spot

### The (metaphorical) carrot at the end of my (metaphorical) stick

My personal and career goals are dictated by cultivating experiences that put me in the top 25%ile of a set of skills. There are so many skills in the world. I just need to be the top 25%ile in two to three of them. Today, within my my network of friends and peers, I like to think of myself as being one of the best programmers who can write prose. While that distinction doesn't mean much, it gives me hope in creating other such distinctions that would mean a lot and make me very valuable.

The world has so many possibilites. Take a bit of _X_ and throw in a bit of _Y_ and you have something special all of a sudden. Peloton came from the question "What if I could attend [Soul Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoulCycle) classes anytime, anywhere?". Apple came from the question "What if I could have a computer at home?". Cisco came from the question, "What if networks could network with other networks?". These were, at the time, new ideas. These ideas manifested into real world entities because of talented people who were either the best in their field, or above average in many fields [^3]

This is the (metaphorical) carror at the end of my (metaphorical) stick, there are so many ideas yet explored, and maybe one day I could be bringing one of these ideas to the real world.
