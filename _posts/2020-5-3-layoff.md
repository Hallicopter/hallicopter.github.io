## Tales of layoffs, job search and redemption in the covid era

### Part one:  Guys, I am gainfully employed! 
#### I got placed. Yay?
My hunt for the the daily grind began back in the penultimate semester of college. I partook in the usual vetting process, involving copious amounts competitive coding, tests, interviews, the whole nine yards. Fast forward to me burning burning through way more formal shirts than I care to admit, I land a job. I wasn't unhappy with the job, but I wasn't really satisfied with it either. This was a giant company, which had been consistently losing money for the last many years. The business unit I was hired for was in the healthcare sector, and was one of their few profitable ventures. It was a software dev role, but I knew this was not the environment I wanted to work in - a flailing corporate giant, that was but a shadow of its glorious past. 
Also, its interesting to note that this was what we call in the placement business a "P+I" offer, which meant that, they were offering a full time role, after my internship ended. Also, its interesting to note, the name of the company sounded eerily similar to the phrase "generally eclectic (wealthcare)".

#### Hunt for the elusive off campus placement
By the beginning of early November, I started looking for jobs over at the greener pastures of the internets. The problem here is nobody replies on the internets, and this resulted in me hounding a lot of good HR folk into giving me a chance to work at their company. This paid off, and after many a online tests, and interviews, I ended up getting picked by two companies. One was an open source giant, which seemed weirdly obsessed with red fedoras, and the other company was an Indonesian travel unicorn (little did I know the fate of this industry at the time).  I really wanted to work in a fast growth phase company, and ended up joining the travel tech company. They offered me the good ol' 'P+I' deal, and I took it.  
I genuinely loved my work, and enjoyed working there. I was learning a lot, and pushing production code, and coordinating with teams. I was finally gainfully employed. 


### Part Two: Covid cucked me.

#### How it went down
We all knew every ship in the industry was sinking, so it wasn't much of a surprise when the HR called me and told me that they would be rescinding the offer, and would be glad to let me go per my convenience. It was also kind of funny that I lost my first job, before technically even joining.

#### Hounding the HRs
Well, here is where I wanted to breakdown my covid job hunt. On the whole, I had applied to over a 100 jobs, mainly on AngelList, LinkedIn and company websites.

Here is how that went:

I seriously started my job hunt around mid March of 2020, when the lock-down was in place here in India, and layoffs were abound. It was a tough time lose a job, and not many companies were hiring. By April end, I was fortunate enough to have a new job, without compromising on work quality, and compensation.

Here is a rough split up of the industries these companies where in:

Note that, I have tried to split up companies based on their market rather than tech, for example instead of classifying Locale.ai, and Observe.ai as the same "AI" companies, they are classified as analytics, and automation companies, that happen to use machine learning to achieve a solution.

It is interesting to note that the fintech slice of the pie is the largest, indicating that a lot of companies are sprouting to cater towards out generally underbanked population, but with an impending recession, I am not sure how this companies will do in the future. The ed tech space should be seeing a major growth due to the covid crisis. Safe to say any logistics, or travel company is a dumpster fire at the moment.

Fortunately for me, the company that I am expected to join soon is anticipating massive growth as a result of the covid crisis. 
Investors sometimes use a term, "the magic moment", to describe the moments when a company would experience a massive growth in their market, and opportunity. For paytm, demonitisation was their "magic moment". For the company I intend to join, the covid crisis is their "magic moment". 





Work in progress

Peace, and death to covid.
