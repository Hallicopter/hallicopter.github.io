By the numbers.

This is going to super short. Read if you match the following criteria
- Like chick lit
- Like a hate to love storyline
- Just want something feel good
- Don't mind the cliches and streotypes

The book is fairly decently written, and a breeze to read. Genre aficionados would love it. I give it a 3/5
