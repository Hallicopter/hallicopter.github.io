I am that guy now.

## The OND quarter of books.
At the end of October this year, I resolved to read a book per week. I am glad that I have exceeded my expectations, having read 18 books since then. In this journey so far, I have discovered a couple of things
* I love reading, more than I thought.
* Number of books per unit time is a bad metric, if it gets in the way of me picking up heavier books. I should just make sure, I always have something to read.
# The stats roundup.
* Pages consumed: ~5600
* Books read: 18
* Longest book: ~600 pages ([Thinking, fast and slow.](https://advait.live/thinking-fast-slow/))
* Shortest book: ~110 pages ([Sum: Forty tales of afterlives](https://advait.live/sum/))
* Average book length: ~310 pages
## Year end list (in no particular order)
I am going to read fiction, and non-fiction. But considering I mostly read non-fiction, the list will be biased towards it. I am adding an arbitrary number of books, that have stuck with me.
* [Deep Work](https://advait.live/Deep-work/)
* [Atomic Habits](https://advait.live/Atomic-Habits/)
* [Sapiens](https://advait.live/sapiens/)
* [The Psychology of Money](https://advait.live/psychology-of-money/)
* [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://advait.live/naval-ravikant/)
* [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://advait.live/fastlane/)
* [Livewired](https://advait.live/Livewired/)
* [Why we sleep?](https://advait.live/why-we-sleep/)
*  [Sum: Forty tales of afterlives](https://advait.live/sum/)
## Books I particularly disliked, and will actively hate on.
