Feel good, almost to a fault.

## The premise
The story follows the titular Heidi, and her journey of self discovery. She is the stereotypical shy, cute and awkward girl, who recently got laid of from her school teacher job. She also has a crush on her next door neighbour, and her overcoming her fears and getting together with her neighbour Brent make the crux of the arc. The way she overcomes her fears is by putting her out there in the form of a podcast called "Heidi's Discount Erotica". Overall, there is a little bit of a twist to your usual premise, but nothing groundbreaking.
## Saccharine to a fault?
There is barely any conflict in the book. At least I didn't find any. Things just happen, and they are not bad. The writing is not the worst, and if you like the usual tropes of the genre, there are some funny bits in here. 

I give this a 3/5.
