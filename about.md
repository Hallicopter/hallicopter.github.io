This is Advait Raykar's poor attempt to be have a presence on the internet. He may never update this blog (Under-promise and over deliver). 
He is an undergrad computer science student who enjoys computer science.
This blog will probably contain whatever piques his interest, mostly trashy science, maybe some film stuff, and concepts generally way out of his league.

### More Information

He is a big fan of writing about himself in third person.

### Structure
