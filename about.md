#### Footnotes
[^1]: So, what, you may ask, is VC Chic? Since I coined the term, I get to define it. Its a very vague category of things that usually resonate with the VC kind. Things like startups, new technology, the sciences, big ideas. Paint a picture with these as a seed: Sapiens, Blockchain, Series A Deep-tech startup, Leverage compounding. Your are visualing VC-chic.
