This is Advait Raykar's poor attempt to be have a presence on the internet. He may never update this blog (Under-promise and over deliver). 
He is an undergrad computer science student who enjoys computer science.
This blog will probably contain whatever piques his interest, mostly **trashy science**, maybe some *film stuff*, and concepts *way out of his league*

### More Information

He is a big fan of writing about himself in third person.
