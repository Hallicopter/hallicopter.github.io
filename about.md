This is Advait Raykar's poor attempt to be have a presence on the internet. He may never update this blog (Under-promise and over deliver). 
He is software engineer who enjoys computer science, data and food.
This blog will probably contain whatever piques his interest, mostly trashy science, maybe some film stuff, and concepts generally way out of his league.

### More Information

He is a big fan of writing about himself in third person.

### Structure

* **blog** posts I took a while to write, and I consider polished
* **books** short book reviews
* **thoughts** random thoughts, and unpolished pieces
