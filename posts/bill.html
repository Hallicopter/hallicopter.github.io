                <p>My history with comics.</p>
<p>As a kid, I always loved comics. Ever since I was little, we always had comics in some form or the other. My earliest memory of reading a comic was in the children's magazine <a href="https://www.indiamags.com/magic-pot-magazine">Magic Pot</a> - my mother had a brief stint as a distributor for the magazine when I was in kindergarten. Even 15 years after never having opened a Magic Pot, I still remember the comic strips about the escapades of the mischievous devil, Lutappi and how he always failed in his devilry. It was so whimsical, and little me loved it.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I lost interest in these tiny little strips which got boring beyond a point. I started reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkle">Tinkle</a> , a magazine which every Indian kid had read at some point. The stories were longer, and had more interesting themes; adventure, mystery, comedy - they had it all. I also really got into a series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Underpants">Captain Underpants</a> - yes I know, and its exactly what it sounds like. I particularly remember this series because of how much it inspired me to create my own comics strip series (the plot of Captain Underpants follows a couple of kids who get popular writing and distributing comic strips about the titular super hero). Flimsy on originality, me and my brother made and distributed a series called "Slipyman and Stickyman" (yes, the typo was a regular feature of the series). It chronicled the adventures of the two titular heroes against the evil mastermind Don Bosco, and his band of goons. Just to clarify, I have nothing against the priest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bosco">Don Bosco</a>, 4th grade me just thought it was a funny name for a villain.</p>
<p>Around this time, I got a subscription to a local library, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JustBooks">JustBooks</a>, which I feel like is a rite of passage for a lot of kids in Bangalore. These JustBooks libraries were everywhere at one point, and I loved visiting them every weekend. This was the first time I was exposed to proper comics, from faraway lands. I devoured the whole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">Tintin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix">Asterix</a> and even dabbled in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke">Lucky Luke</a>. The Europeans really did know their comics, the tales were funny, with memorable characters, and had this sense of adventure I loved. I did always see Calvin and Hobbes lying on the library shelf from the corner of my eyes, but I was so engrossed in these characters, that I never picked it up. </p>
<p>The first time I picked up Calvin and Hobbes was when I took home "Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat".  And then I couldn't stop. I read and read and reread all the books in the series, I loved Calvin - he was whimsical, curious and fun. Little did I know, he may have shaped a lot of my beliefs without me even realizing it. </p>
<p>The artwork was so beautiful, the flowing abstract pages with Calvin and Hobbes just dancing, the imaginative dream sequences, the idle backyards.</p>

<p>As a 6th grader, I was attracted to Calvin and Hobbes for the simple stories, and beautiful art work. Calvin was everything I wanted to be back then, and funnily enough, a decade later, I still want to be Calvin. I never appreciated the comic strip enough, its profundity was something I was equipped to handle back then. Only now do I appreciate the the simple, but powerful truths that were Calvin's philosophy</p>

<p>Calvin and Hobbes taught me so many things, that today make me happy. That remind me what life is about. That make mindful, and re-align myself. Calvin and Hobbes has made me contemplate, and not be swept away by the mundane. He was a mirror to our hedonism.</p>
<p>Calvin was a stoic.
Calvin was an existentialist.
Calvin was happy.</p>

<p>Bill Waterson elevated the comic strip to a high art form, he never let anyone license or sell his work or property. He was an artist, philosopher and a genius.</p>
<p>Calvin and Hobbes will always remind me that Its A Magical World, and There's a Treasure Everywhere.</p>
