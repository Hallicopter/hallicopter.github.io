<p>In this book, "sleep scientist", Matthew Walker gives the history, physiological reasons, evolution, and impact of sleep in our lives. The book is written is a very accessible, and engaging manner. Its something of a page turner for the most part.</p>
<p>The book is split into 4 fairly independent parts
- Part 1: What is even sleep? Does it affect all living creatures, of all ages? Here, he sets up the premise, giving a quick primer on sleep.
- Part 2: In this part, her makes a case for why you should sleep, and how its important for us. This chapter has some very interesting ideas, and some really good advice.
- Part 3: This chapter is all about dreams. I found this chapter super interesting, as it gives a primer on dreams - a historical perspective, and today's modern view on it.
- Part 4: This chapter is the least scientific part of the book. Its basically matthew urging for a change in the society, and talking about good practices, and practical advice for sleep hygiene, and sleep disorders.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this book more than I thought I would. Its worth noting that this book has faced criticism for some scientific "inaccuracies". I have put up the criticism, and the author's rebuttals to them here for posterity
- <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">Criticisms</a>
- <a href="https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/">Rebuttals</a></p>
<p>On the whole, after reading both of the above, its still worth reading this book (it should also be noted, Walker has pretty good credentials himself, and isn't a hack), and honestly, most issues would be addressed in the second edition. After reading the book, its fair to say, this book is still an excellent read.</p>
<p>I would give this book a 4/5.</p>
