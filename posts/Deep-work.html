                <p>I had randomly ended up buying this book off flipkart, because I got a very good deal if I bought this book, along with Atomic Habits. Atomic Habits was the book that I originally wanted to buy, but I am super glad I did indeed end up buying this one too.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Deep work, is about the titular concept of Deep Work, defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This concept seems pretty easy to understand, and it being more effective that shallow work isn't really the biggest revelation anyone would have in their life. The reason that makes this book so good is not the content, but how he systematically builds this idea over the course of the book. This book is as much a commentary on the war for our attention, as it is about how to be more productive.</p>
<p>I think this book is an essential reading for anyone, whether or not they intend to increase their productivity. It will make you reconsider how you spend your time, and lead your life.</p>
<h2>Takeaways for me</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend my hours more consciously.</li>
<li>Get off Reddit. Its a time sink.</li>
<li>Endeavor to have more depth in my personal, and professional work hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actionables for me</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get off Reddit asap.</li>
<li>Think of goals that I want to achieve.</li>
<li>Account for my daily hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd give this a 4.5/5, an essential reading, especially for a tool like me who needed a newer perspective on things.</p>
